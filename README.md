# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this analysis, we have examined the success of theater and play kickstarters based on their launch date and funding goal.

### Purpose
By examining if theater and play kickstarters succeed or fail based on their launch dates and funding goals, we can see if there are trends across parameters to best direct our efforts in future fundraisers, like we did for *Fever* playwright Louise when she wanted help determining specific factors in fundraising campaign success.
